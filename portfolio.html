                            developing a custom controller using Arduino.

                        <p>I developed the AI system for enemies and bosses, designed the dungeon space and room

                        </p>
                        <p>This project is a work in progress; we will continue to develop this game by creating our own
                            models and SFX, adding more accessibility settings, and upgrading our controller prototype.

                        <p>This cooking game was developed and designed 100% by myself, including all models, textures,
                            sound effects, animations, VFX/particles, music, and UI. Over the course of a year, I built
                            each aspect of this project and ran multiple rounds of UX testing.
                        </p>
                        <p>I took a classic cooking game format and created a story and visuals by having the game
                            revolve around a raccoon serving trash in an alleyway, as opposed to chefs serving
                            traditional food, to give this game a unique identity.

                            aspect of the experience was a great challenge, and one that I was eager to take on. This
                            was the first project of mine that I developed 3D assets and music for, and it taught me a
                            lot about 3D design.

                        <p>I worked in a team with classmates to create a 2D Unity game that utilized AR capabilities.
                            The game is a point-and-click shooter in which real-life cards can be scanned each round to
                            give the enemies abilities. One player plays as the wizard, while a second player scans
                            cards
                            to help the enemies win.
                        </p>
                        <p>This project was my introduction to AR in game design. The cards that I designed had to be
                            remade
                            multiple times because of specifications needed for AR-scanning. I also designed the arenas
                            that each level takes place in, and coded menu screens and scene-switching.
                        </p>
                        <p>Starting from scratch and designing a 2D environment that interacted with real-life objects
                            to
                            function was a fun challenge to overcome, and allotting different design aspects to each
                            team member
                            led to a fun mixing of art styles.
